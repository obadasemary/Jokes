#Building a Social Jokes App using Firebase and Swift

Among the best and most popular BaaSs is Google's Firebase. Actually, Firebase is positively fantastic in performance, implementation, and upkeep. The key to Firebase's immediate value is its realtime database that stores data in JSON. Any change in the database is immediately synced across all clients, or devices, that use the same database. In other words, Firebase is ridiculously fast; everything is updated instantly.

Firebase also offers user authentication along with storage, and all data is transferred via a secure SSL connection. For authentication, we can choose from any combination of email and password, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Google, or a custom solution.
